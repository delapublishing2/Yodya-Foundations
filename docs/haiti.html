                      <p>Since February 2024, gang violence has surged, driving more than 15,000 people from their homes in just one week and further entrenching itself in Port-au-Prince. Other reports suggest that gangs control around 80% of the city, even including the airport. This makes it difficult to provide aid to those who need it most. </p>

                                   <p> FONYO (Or better known as YODYA) is a foundation of young scientists and intellectuals. It initiated in the West Department from Carrefour, Petit Goâve, and the Artibonite Department: Gonaïves and Saint Michel de l'Attalaye on October 24, 2008. This marked its official public utility launch. Recognized for its socio-cultural, professional, economic, and other actions within the community, it is perceived as one of the foundations striving to reclaim the intellectual ideal and contribute to social life and public affairs. It is a socio-professional, scientific, cultural, and non-profit foundation.  </p>
                                    
                                    <p>We offer financial assistance, food, resources, clothing, supplies, toiletries, training opportunities, and more to those in need. We target disaster areas, such as Haiti, and aim to give less fortunate people a helping hand and a chance for opportunities and success. We ask that you join us in our fight. We are passionate individuals about our goals and mission, so let’s band together and help one another. </p>

                                    <p>Did you know Haiti is the first independent nation in Latin America and the Caribbean, having won its freedom from French colonial rule in 1804? Interestingly, although they received freedom in 1804, it was not until 1864 that Haiti received full acknowledgment from the United States. Haiti was among the first to abolish slavery in the Americas. It is also the only nation created as a result of a successful slave rebellion. </p>

                  <p>Haiti, a country the size of Maryland, is the second oldest republic in the Western Hemisphere after the United States. Haiti boasted stunning landscapes, from its lush mountains to pristine beaches that rival any postcard. Its vibrant culture dances to the beats of Compas music and celebrates rich traditions like Carnivals! And that's not all! Haiti showcased its other treasures, from the Citadelle Laferrière, a stunning fortress located at the top of Haiti's mountains, to the Bassin Bleu, with waterfalls and natural pools where beautiful turquoise waters lay.</p>
                  <p>BUT now Haiti has lost its luster. According to <a href="https://www.usaid.gov/document/haiti-nutrition-profile#:~:text=Haiti%20is%20the%20poorest%20country,the%20poorest%20in%20the%20world.">USAID.gov</a>, it is now one of the poorest countries in the world.</p>

                           <h2>What Happened to Haiti?</h2>
                <p>Sadly, this independent nation has been ravaged by poverty, violence, and political diaspora. According USAID.gov it is now one of the poorest countries in the world. 
                    A country that was once flourishing with phenomenal leadership and independence is now a country that is riddled with poverty, anarchy, famine, and war. </p>
                           <p>The situation in Haiti is heart-wrenching, and the numbers tell a tough story. International aid is crucial right now, but we also need long-term solutions to tackle the root causes of these crises.  Haiti needs help and YODYA is stepping up to the plate. We cannot do it alone though, which is why we need your hand. </p>
                           <p> Please help us in our fight to give a hand to struggling women, families, children, and elderly in Haiti. Join us as we aim to build and restore Haiti. </p>
